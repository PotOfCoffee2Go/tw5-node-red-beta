TW5-Node-RED implements a unique server generated [[JSON Web Token (JWT)|https://jwt.io/]] access/bearer token which is required for socket.io requests (which carry the tiddlers) to be accepted by the server. Bearer tokens are not implemented for HTTP requests (such as static content and 'http-in' nodes). There are express middleware and Node-RED nodes that can be used to implement various HTTP security strategies.  

The token for the connection is generated when the first heartbeat is received by the [[Network|Network tab]] and [[security system|Security tab]]. The client is given the token and returns it in `$:/temp/tw5-node-red/store` tiddler - [[meta data tiddlers|$:/poc2go/docs/msg/meta]] of ''every message'' excluding hearbeats which are light-weight.
