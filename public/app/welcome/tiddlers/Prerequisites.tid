Will need the normal cast of characters to include [ext[node.js|https://nodejs.org]], [ext[git|https://git-scm.com]], and a favorite editor. Both [ext[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] and [ext[Node-RED|https://nodered.org]] are installed locally with the [[project]]. Neither has been modified in any way, other than documented settings required to configure the system. Attempt has been made to insure as new release tolerant as possible.

[ext[nodemon|https://nodemon.io/]] can be handy to automatically restart the server but only if on the rare chance are making custom Node-Red nodes from scratch - which is fun but only for the brave.

The system installs all software needed to operate. However, to create applications will require '<span class="poc2go-dir">npm install tiddlywiki -g</span>' and is recommend to global install Node-Red.
