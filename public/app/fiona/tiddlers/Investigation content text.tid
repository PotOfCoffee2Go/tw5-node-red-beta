<p><i>“The investigator should have a robust faith - and yet not believe.”</i></p>
<p>What do you think Claude Bernard meant by this?</p>

<p>At Fiona Solutions, we interpret that quote as this; to gather all of the evidence in order to prove the criminality beyond a reasonable doubt. There is often very little doubt that an offender of a war crime is committing the atrocity, and yet historically few of these offenders are held accountable.</p>

<p>Our process ensures the proper investigation is performed and that the offenders are charged to the highest extent in any court around the globe.</p>

<p>From the first message we receive from the client, the Reasonable Complaint, we begin to collect inculpatory and exculpatory evidence against the accused. Our Investigators write thorough and detailed reports throughout the mission, documenting the scene with videos and photographs, identifying and collective physical pieces of evidence, and interviewing all those involved. Victims, witnesses, and even those accused will be interviewed by Investigators.</p>

<p>One of the most important functions our organization provides is testimony in any court. Our investigators will dutifully recount their findings to any court around the world, so that justice can be achieved for those oppressed.</p>
