title: 1.5.3. The Story River

The left side of the Tiddlywiki is called the Story River and shows all open tiddlers.

A typical wiki contains hundreds or thousands of tiddlers, some of them open in the left side and others closed stored in the file. You can search the closed tiddlers with the search bar or with the menus.
